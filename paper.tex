\begin{abstract} 
% Broad absorption lines (BALs) in the ultraviolet 
% are seen in $\sim20\%$ of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). 
% Blue-shifted broad absorption lines (BALs) are the most direct evidence of 
% accretion disc `winds' in such systems; mass loaded outflows
% emanating from the disc that may be driven by line forces or
% magnetic processes. 
Various unification schemes for
quasars and luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) have proposed
that the broad emission line region is roughly cospatial
with broad absorption line (BAL) gas and much of the phenomenology of luminous AGN
can be explained by a simple geometrical picture involving an accretion
disc and associated outflow. Here, we test this paradigm by 
utilising our state-of-the-art radiative transfer code to produce synthetic spectra
from simple biconical disc wind models. In particular, we expand on our previous 
work in which a benchmark model for BAL quasars was produced. 
We find that a simple treatment of clumping (`microclumping') 
allows for a more realistic X-ray luminosity in the model by lowering the 
ionization parameter. We examine the X-ray properties of this new model
and find good agreement with existing X-ray samples of AGN and QSOs.
We find that clumping enhances the H recombination and collisionally excited resonance lines,
causing strong line emission (EW=?) to emerge at the low inclination angles, 
which represent quasars within this unification scenario.
% We also treat Hydrogen using a `macro-atom' approach in order to 
% examine the effect of recombination on Hydrogen emission lines, and
% this results in significant line emission in Lyman~$\alpha$ and the Balmer series.
However, we are unable to produce line emission with comparable equivalent widths
to existing quasar composites, due to a fundamental constraint arising
from the anisotropy of emission from a classical thin disc. We briefly 
explore the effect of relativistic beaming, gravitational redshift and 
light bending on the angular distribution of disc continuum emission. 
We find that these general relativistic effects do cause the disc to
emit more isotropically, but this is not yet sufficient to produce a
self-consistent model. We discuss a number of potential solutions. 
Overall, our work suggests that geometric unification
involving an accretion disc wind is a promising scenario, but our results 
pose a number of difficult challenges to such a model.
% Determining the true geometry of ADWs and uncovering the true disc spectral 
% (and angular) energy distribution are key next steps if we are to build up a 
% holistic picture of the quasar population.

\section{Introduction}

% Introduction focussing on key points
% \begin{itemize}
% \item standard wind + BALQSO introduction
% \item focus on unification and that we are testing it
% \item some discussion of scales, referencing e.g. reverb maps, variability, microlensing, Arav 
% \item clumping background: stellar winds, clumping in AGN winds, variability
% \end{itemize}

The spectra of 
quasars and luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) 
typically exhibit a series of strong emission lines
with an underlying blue continuum - the so-called {\sl `big blue bump'} (BBB). 
The BBB is normally attributed to emission from a geometrically thin, 
optically thick accretion disc surrounding the central black hole (REF), similar
to that described by \cite{shakurasunyaev1973}.
In addition to the inflowing accreting material, 
outflows are ubiquitous in AGN
and quasars \citep{kellerman1989,ganguly2008}. These outflows can take the form of 
highly collimated radio jets \citep[e.g.][]{hazard1963,potash1980,perley1984,marscher2006}, 
or mass-loaded `winds' emanating from the accretion disc 
\citep{weymann1991,turnermiller2009}. 
Outflows in AGN offer a 
potential feedback mechanism through which the central source can 
affect its environment \citep{king2003,king2005,fabian2012}
-- feedback that is required in models of galaxy evolution (REFs) 
and may explain the `$M-\sigma$' relation \citep{silkrees1998,haring2004}.

Approximately $20\%$ of quasars exhibit broad absorption lines (BALs) in the ultraviolet,
providing clear evidence for outflowing absorbing material
\citep{weymann1991, reichard2003, knigge2008, turnermiller2009, allen2011}.
The simplest explanation for the incidence of 
BAL quasars (BALQSOs) is in terms of an accretion disc wind (ADW). 
Within this paradigm, the BALQSO fraction is associated with
the covering factor of the outflow.
In addition, ADWs may offer a natural explanation for the
diverse phenemonology of luminous AGN and QSOs \citep[e.g.][]{MCGV95, elvis2000}. 
In such a model, a biconical wind rises from 
the accretion disc, and the class of object is explained by the material
intercepting the line of sight. Depending on viewing angle, an observer 
may then see a BALQSO or normal `Type 1' quasar.
Within this framework, the broad-line region (BLR) is normally
assumed to correspond to the dense wind base.
There are various spectroscopic sub-classifications of BALQSOs: 
HiBALQSOs, which only exhibit higher
ionization line absorption; LoBALQSOs which also show
absorption in lower ionization state species such as \mg\ and \al; and
FeLoBALQSOs which show further absorption in Fe~\textsc{ii} and \textsc{iii}.
In unified models, this is generally attributed to ionization stratification
of the outflow \citep[e.g.][]{elvis2000}.

% As well as acting as a source of photoionized plasma, a 
As well as imprinting clear line absorption features,
disc wind may also have a profound effect on the structure and 
emergent {\em continuum} of the accretion disc itself.
Mass-loss will alter the accretion rate and resultant 
temperature of the accretion disc, possibly explaining some 
of the features we typically see in luminous AGN \citep{laordavis2014}.
Recent results from \cite{capellupo2015} find 
that if one includes a combination of mass-loss, general relativity (GR) and Comptonisation
then AGN spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can, in general, be fitted well with accretion disc models.
Mass-loss therefore appears to be critical if an $\alpha$-disc
model is to successfully fit AGN SEDs, particular in the UV region of the spectrum.

Despite the clear importance of ADWs in understanding AGN SEDs and accretion physics, 
much of the underlying outflow physics remains highly uncertain. 
Several possible driving mechanisms for ADWs have been proposed, including
thermal pressure \citep{weymann1982, begelman1991}, magnetocentrifugal forces 
\citep{blandfordpayne,pelletier_pudritz} and 
radiation pressure on spectral lines \citep[`line-driving';][]{lucysolomon1970,shlosman1985,MCGV95}.
Of these, line-driving is possibly the most attractive, as
strong absorption lines are already seen in BALQSOs and the X-ray spectra of AGN 
\citep{reeves2003,poundsreeves2009,tombesi2010a}.
The presence of line-locked features \citep{bowler2014} 
and the `ghost of \la' (Arav et al. 1996; Arav 1996; North 2006; but see 
also Cottis et al. 2010) \nocite{arav1995, arav1996, north2006,cottis2010}
in the spectra of some BALQSOs also gives clearer evidence that line-driving is
at least partially contributing to the acceleration of the wind.

The efficiency of line-driving is crucially dependent on the ionization state 
of the outflowing plasma. \cite{MCGV95} proposed a potential solution: 
a region of `hitchhiking gas' that could shield the wind from the central X-ray source. 
Hydrodynamic simulations of line-driven disc winds also found a shielding region
was required to maintain the correct ionization state \citep{PSK2000,PK04}. 
However, \cite{H14} showed that including multiple scattering means the ionizing radiation 
field could still reach the previously shielded regions in those particular models.
An alternative solution is that the wind is clumped \citep[e.g.][]{hamann2013}
possibly on multiple scale lengths. Local density enhancements could lower the 
ionization parameter of the plasma while still maintaining the same mass-loss 
rate and column density. 


Evidence for dense substructures in AGN winds is widespread.
BALQSOs show complex absorption line profiles \citep{ganguly2006, simonhamann2010}
and exhibit variability in these profile shapes \citep{capellupo2011,capellupo2012,capellupo2014}.
AGN generally show variability in X-ray absorption components \citep[e.g.][]{risaliti2002}
and many models for the BLR consist of clumps embedded in an outflow 
\citep{krolik1981, emmering1992, dekool1995, cassidyraine1996}.
Clumping can be caused by magnetic confinement \cite{dekool1995},
or the instabilities inherent to line-driven winds 
\citep{lucysolomon1970,macgregor1979,carlberg1980,owockirybicki1984,owockirybicki1985}.
Additionally, clumping is required in line-driven hot star winds 
in order to explain observations \citep{hillier1991eswingsmodel}. Complex substructures 
on a variety of scales are also produced in simulations of line-driven 
outflows in AGN \citep{PSK2000,PK04,progakurosawa2010,proga2014}.
Clumpy winds therefore offer an observationally motivated and theoretically 
predicted way to lower the ionization state of a plasma, possibly in tandem
with a shielding scenario. 




% An inhomogenous outflow has been proposed as a model for the BLR (REFs)
% Clumping is expected in outflows and BLRs.


% The UV spectrum of {\em non-BAL} QSOs is typified by a series
% of strong emission lines (e.g. \la, \civ, \nv) with an underlying blue continuum
% - the so-called {\sl `big blue bump'} (BBB). The BBB is normally attributed to blackbody-like
% emission from an accretion disc surrounding the central black hole (REF), similar
% to that described by \cite{shakurasunyaev1973}. However,
% a number of issues have arisen relating to this model. First, 
% AGN/QSO spectra exhibit a `break' in the spectrum at around $1000$~\AA 
% which scales only weakly with black hole mass. This potentially 
% suggests a problem with a thin disc model (e.g. Antonucci). 
% However, it is possible that this is the result of incorrect intergalactic medium
% (IGM) corrections (REF) or corresponds to the temperature 
% at which a line-driven wind carries mass away from the system (laor davis).
% Second, results from microlensing (REFs) imply that the disc emission 
% region is $\sim4$ times larger than one might expect from a Shakura-Sunyaev
% model. Inhomogenous discs have been proposed as an alternative (REFs).
% These observations appear to pose problems for the thin disc model of luminous,
% sub-Eddington AGN. However, recent results from \cite{capellupo2015} find 
% that if one includes a combination of mass-loss, general relativity (GR) and Comptonisation
% then AGN SEDs can, in general, be fitted well with accretion disc models.
% Uncovering the intrinsic disc SED and understanding the effect of the outflow on the accretion 
% mechanism is clearly crucial if we are to properly understand the physical nature
% of AGN.

% The geometry and size of the BLR is also a matter of contention. 
% The main constraints on the emission region size come from microlensing (REFs)
% and reverberation mapping (REFs). While these observations have mostly been
% carried out for Seyfert galaxies, there are also a few instances of these methods
% being applied to quasars (REFs). A number of different proposals have been made 
% for the origin of the BLR. Early AGN unification scenarios posited that the broad emission lines
% where produced by clouds of plasma orbiting fairly close to the BH (refs).
% Since then, multiple interpretations of a disc wind model have been proposed,
% with varying radii and geometries (refs). 

There has been some success using simple
kinematic prescriptions for biconical disc winds to model 
AGN and quasar outflows \citep{simlong2008,higginbottom2013}. 
\cite[][hereafter H13]{higginbottom2013},
successfully produced a benchmark model for BALQSOs. However, the model
had two key drawbacks. Firstly, an unrealistically low X-ray luminosity
was required in order to prevent over-ionization of the outflow.
Secondly, the model failed to produce the strong emission lines 
required at low inclinations in a unified model.
In this paper, we attempt to address these issues, and test the disc wind 
unification model using Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) and photoionization 
calculations. The paper is organised as follows.
In section 2, we describe our code. In section 3, we outline the model, including 
a description of our clumping prescription. In section 4, we present the results 
from a clumped model. In section 5 we discuss our results, 
focussing particular on the anisotropy of 
disc emission and GR effects, and finally, in section 6, we summarise our findings.



%  a simple model in which
% quasars are unified by BH mass, Eddington ratio and viewing angle can successfully
% reproduce UV, optical and X-ray properties of {\em both} 
% BALQSO's and normal emission line quasars. 

% Geometrical unification pictures have suggested that 
% the BAL fraction can be interpreted as the covering factor
% of an accretion disc wind (refs), and some also propose
% that this disc wind may also be the source of the broad emission
% lines (BELs) seen in QSOs (refs). 
% Alternatively, there are a number of evolutionary models in which
% QSOs spend approximately $20\%$ of their lifetime as BALQSOs in which the outflow
% has a high covering factor (refs). 
% It is also possible that BALQSOs lie in a distinct region
% in terms of Eddington ratio (refs), but this is somewhat refuted 
% by observations (refs). % to e.g. Allen and Eigenvector I papers Ledd of BALQSOs
% Orientation, evolution, black hole mass and eddington ratio 
% may all have an effect on the BAL fraction (refs),  % to e.g. Allen
% and the importance of each must be understood to build up coherent picture.


% The driving mechanism for accretion disc winds is uncertain. The winds responsible 
% for BALs must at least have some line-driven component,
% as very strong resonance lines exert a strong line force on the 
% gas (refs). Line-driven winds are notoriously unstable 
% \citep{lucysolomon1970,macgregor1979,owockirybicki1984,owockirybicki1985}.
% meaning that one may expect an unstable and inhomogenous 
% velocity and density structure (refs). Magnetically driven
% winds may also produce clumpy winds or `clouds' of material which
% are magnetically confined (refs here to Shlosman, Begelman and the like).
% Describe mechanism.

% Evidence for an inhomogenous density structure in an accretion disc wind 
% and/or the broad emission line region comes from multiple sources. 
% Microlensing observations of absorption troughs suggest that different lines of sight 
% exhibit varying velocity components (refs), and BALQSO troughs 
% are known to exhibit variability (refs).

\section{Ionization and Radiative Transfer}

We use the MCRT code \py\ to carry out our radiative transfer and photoionization
calculations in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE). 
The code is described extensively by a series of authors (LK02, S05, H13, M15).
For that reason we only briefly describe the key elements of the global 
ionization calculation and other important aspects.

\subsection{Line transfer}

To treat line transfer, we adopt the same hybrid scheme 
described by M15, 
in which the energy flows
through the system are described in terms of indivisible
energy quanta of radiant or kinetic energy 
(`$r-$packets' and `$k-$packets' respectively; see also section 2.3).
These energy packets interacting with either `simple ions'
or `macro-atoms'. The macro-atom implementation 
is described in full by \cite{lucy2002, lucy2003}.
The scheme allows one to treat non-LTE line transfer in radiative equilibrium
without approximation for elements which are identified as 
full macro-atoms, while maintaining the fast `two-level' 
treatment of resonance lines when elements are identified 
as simple-ions. In this study,
only H \& He are treated as macro-atoms, because 
we expect recombination to be important
in determining their level populations (see M15).

\subsection{Ionization Scheme}

Macro-atoms have their ion and level populations derived from
MC rate estimators as described by M15. Previously (LK02, H13, M15),
we adopted a modified Saha approach to calculate the ionization fractions
of simple-ions. We have now improved our code to explicitly solve the 
rate equations in between ions in non-LTE. 
Not only does this
dispense with a number of small assumptions made in the modified Saha approach, 
it is also more numerically stable, 
and in principle allows the direct addition of extra physical 
processes such as Auger ionization, which would have to be approximated 
if using the previous technique.

To avoid approximating the complex AGN SED as e.g. a dilute blackbody \citep[][M15]{ML93},
we model the SED in a cell using the technique described by H13. In this scheme,
the mean intensity in a series of bands is modeled as a normalised power law in 
frequency $\nu$
\begin{equation}
J_{\nu,j}=K_{pl}\nu^{\alpha_{pl}},
\end{equation}
for a band $j$, or an exponential 
\begin{equation}
J_{\nu,j}=K_{exp} e^{(-h\nu/k T_{exp})}.
\end{equation}
Here, $K_{exp}$, $K_{pl}$, $T_{exp}$ and $\alpha_{pl}$ are spectral fit parameters
deduced from the band-limited radiation field estimators.
The ionization rate out of ion $i$ can then be written as 
\begin{equation}
R_{i,i+1}(J)= 
\displaystyle{
n_i \left(C_{i} n_e + 
\sum_{band~j=0}^{n}~
{\int_{\nu_j}^{~\nu_j+1}{J_{\nu,j}\sigma_i(\nu)\nu^{-1}d\nu}}
\right),}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_i$ is the photoionization cross-section and $C_{i}$
represents the collisional ionization coefficient.
The recombination rate {\em into} ion $i$ is simply given by 
\begin{equation}
R_{i+1,i}(T_e) = (\alpha^i_{RR} + \alpha^i_{DR} + \alpha^i_{CR}) n_{i+1} n_e
\end{equation}
Where each $\alpha$ here is the recombination rate coefficient into the ground state of ion $i$.
The subscripts denote radiative, dielectronic and 
collisional (three-body) recombination respectively.
We thus neglect recombination to and from excited states in the simple-ion calculation. 
For simple-ions, we use a dilute Boltzmann equation to calculate 
the population of level $k$ in ionic stage $j$,
\begin{equation}
\frac{n_{jk}}{n_j} = \frac{W g_k}{z_j(T_R)} \exp(-E_k/kT_R).
\end{equation}
Here $z_j$ is the partition function of ionic stage $j$,
$T_R$ is the effective radiation temperature,
$E_k$ is the energy difference between level $k$ and the ground state,
and $g_k$ is the statistical weight of level $k$. 

% We improve on this method by abandoning the modified Saha approach
% entirely, and instead computing the ionization state by 
% explicitly solving the rate equations in between ions in non-LTE. 
% Photoionization and recombination rates are calculated using MC estimators recorded
% during the photon propagation. Not only does this dispense with a number of
% small assumptions made in the modified Saha approach, it is also more numerically stable, 
% and in principle allows the direct addition of extra physical processes such as Auger ionization, which would have to be approximated if using the previous technique.
\subsection{Physical Processes}

We include all free-free, bound-free and bound-bound heating
and cooling processes in the model. For radiative transfer purposes
we treat electron scattering in the Thomson limit, 
but take full account of Compton heating and cooling when
calculating the thermal balance of the plasma (see H13).
Adiabatic cooling is included and represents the only
departure from strict radiative equilibrium, but is insignificant 
in most of the outflow.
It is dealt with self consistently by the spontaneous destruction
of $k$-packets with a probability

\begin{equation}
P_{\rm{adiabatic~destruction}} = \frac{C_{\rm{adiabatic}}}{C_{\rm{total}}},
\end{equation}
where $C_{\rm{adiabatic}}$ and ${C_{\rm{total}}}$ represent the 
adiabatic and total cooling rates in the cell.


\subsection{Atomic Data}

We use the same atomic data as described by LK02 and since updated by H13 and M15, 
with the addition of direct ionization data from \cite{dere2007}. 
Photoionization cross-sections are from \textsc{Topbase} \citep{cunto1993} and  \cite{vfky}.
Dielectronic and radiative recombination rate coefficients are taken from 
the \textsc{Chianti} database version 7.0 \citep{dere1997,landi2012}.
We use ground state recombination rates from \cite{badnell2006} where available,
and otherwise default to calculating recombination rates from the Milne
relation. Free-free Gaunt factors are from \cite{sutherland1998}.

\section{A Clumpy Biconical Disk Wind Model for Quasars}

Our kinematic prescription for a biconical disc wind model
follows \cite{SV93}, and is described further by
LK02, H13 and M15. A schematic is shown in figure~\ref{fig:cartoon},
with key aspects marked. The general biconical
geometry is similar to that invoked by \cite{MCGV95} and 
\cite{elvis2000} in order to explain the phenomenonology
of quasars and BALQSOs.

\end{figure} 



% \subsection{A Benchmark Model for BALQSOs}

% \cite{higginbottom2013} presented a benchmark model for
% (BAL)QSOs...introduce key parameters. 

\subsection{Photon Sources}

%Describe the photon sources in the model.

The accretion disc in our model is geometrically thin, but optically thick
and this adopt a standard multi-temperature blackbody
using a \cite{shakurasunyaev1973} temperature profile. 
The emergent SED is thus determined by the specified accretion rate ($\dot{m}$)
and central BH mass ($M_{BH}$).
The inner radius of the disc extends to the innermost 
stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the BH. 
We assume a Schwarzchild BH with an ISCO at $6~R_G$.
The X-ray source in our model is treated as an isotropic sphere at the ISCO,
which emits photons according to a power law with index $\alpha_X$.
The normalisation of this power law is such that it produces the specified 
2-10kev luminosity.
In addition to the disc and X-ray source, 
the wind is able to reprocess radiation. However, new 
photon packets are not produced in the wind (as in LK02). 
Instead, this reprocessing is dealt with by enforcing strict
radiative equilibrium via an indivisible energy packet
constraint (see Lucy 2002, M15).
% \begin{equation}

% With a normalisation such that it produces the correct 2-10kev luminosity.

% Photons striking the 





% which successfully reproduced BAL features 
% in synthetic spectra using \py. However, the model
% had a few key drawbacks when considering its potential
% for unification. First, it failed to produce significant
% broad emission lines at non-BAL viewing angles; this is 
% a key requirement for a unified QSO model. Second,
% the model was significantly X-ray weak, as it was found
% that an X-ray luminosity comparable to that of a QSO 
% over-ionized the wind, resulting in no UV resonance 
% line absorption features.

\subsection{Kinematics and Geometry}

Describe briefly the kinematics and geometry of the model.

\subsection{Clumping}

To take account of clumping in our outflow we adopt a simple parameterization
used in stellar wind modelling, known as {\em microclumping} \citep{hamann1998}. 
The key assumption here is that typical clump sizes
are much smaller than the typical photon mean free path, and thus the clumps are 
both geometrically and optically thin. This approach is typically 
known as microclumping and allows one to introduce a `filling factor', $f$, which is the 
fraction of the volume of the plasma filled by clumps. We can then introduce the 
density enhancement, $D$, which is simply defined as 
\begin{equation}
D = \frac{1}{f}.
\end{equation}
We then multiply all densities in the model by $D$, and all emitting volumes
by $f$, meaning that all $\rho^2$ emissivities and opacities
(such as collisional excitation and recombination) will be enhanced, 
while all $\rho$ process (such as electron scattering and bound-free opacity)
remain unchanged for a given ionization state. 
% A factor $f$ is also
% applied to the opacities such that opacities which scale only with $\rho$ are not
% increased. 

Clumping the wind has an important effect on the ionization state and has
been proposed as a solution to the so-called `over-ionization problem' in 
disc winds (REFs). This is the main motivation for incorporating microclumping
into our model. This treatment is first-order; it does not adequately
represent the complex substructures and stratifications in ionization
state we expect in AGN outflows. Nevertheless, clumping is clearly
important in these flows, and this parameterization allows a simple estimate
for the effect clumping might have on the ionization state and emergent 
line emission. It is also encouraging that microclumping has been used 
successfully in fits to O-star wind spectra (REFs).

\section{Results}

Here we describe the results from our model. This set of parameters
was arrived at by conducting a limited grid search over a 
5-dimensional parameter space involving the variables
$r_{min}$, $\theta_{min}$, $f$, $\alpha$ and $R_V$.
We then evaluated these models qualitavely based on the following
criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\item Does the model maintain the correct ionization state and produce strong BALs?
\item Does strong line emission emerge at low inclinations?
\item Do H recombination lines appear in the spectrum?
\item Do a certain range of angles produce LoBAL features?
\end{itemize}

We arrived at a model which is one of the most promising,
but also representative of a family of models. Examination 
of this individual model allows us to gain insight
into fundamental geometrical and physical constraints, 
as discussed in section 5.

\subsection{Physical Conditions and Ionization State}

The wind rises slowly from the disc at first, with clumped densities
of $n_H \sim 10^{11}~\rm{cm^{-3}}$ close to the disc plane.
The flow then accelerates over a scale length of $R_V=10^{19}~\rm{cm}$
up to a terminal velocity of around $3$ times the escape velocity 
($\sim10,000~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$). This gradual acceleration means that
the wind exhibits a stratified ionization structure, with low ionization material
in the base of the wind giving way to highly ionized plasma further out.
By clumping the wind, we are able to produce the range of ionization states observed
in Quasars and BALQSOs, while adopting a realistic $2-10$ keV X-ray luminosity
of $L_{X}=10^{45}~\rm{ergs~s^{-1}}$. Without clumping, this wind would be over-ionized 
to the extent that opacities in e.g., \civ\ would be entirely negligible (see H13).

One commonly used measure of the ionization state is the ionization parameter, $U$, given by
\begin{equation}
U = \frac{4\pi}{n_H c}\int_{13.6{\rm{eV}}}^{\infty}\frac{{J_{\nu}d\nu}}{h\nu}.
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\rm{n_H}$ is the local number density of H, and $\nu$ denotes photon 
frequency. The ionization parameter represents the ratio of the number density of 
ionizing photons to the local H density. It is however, a poor measure of the 
ionization state of the resonance species such as \civ\ as it encodes no information
about the shape of the SED. In this case the X-ray photons 
are dominant in the photoionization of the UV resonance line ions. 
This explains why a factor of 100 increase in X-ray luminosity requires
a clumping factor of 0.01, even though the value of U changes by roughly ?? compared to 
H13. 

Clumping also causes the total line luminosity to increase dramatically,
as recombination and collisional excitation are both proportional to
$n_e^2$. This line emission typically emerges on the edge of the wind
nearest the central source. The location of the line emitting regions
is dependent on the ionization state, as well as the X-rays heating the plasma.
The radii of these emitting regions is important,
and can be compared to observations. Our \civ\ line emission region 
is located at about $1000~R_G$ ($\sim10^{18}~\rm{cm}$).
This is in rough agreement with the reverberation mapping 
results of Kaspi (2000) for the $2.6\times10^{9} M_\odot$ quasar S5 0836+71,
and also compares favourably with microlensing measurements of the size of the
\civ\ emission line region in the BALQSO H1413+117 \citep{odowd2015}.


\subsection{Synthetic Spectra}

\begin{figure*} %fullpage

\caption

and may show composites, but this would be the main synthetic spectrum plot.

\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/opt.eps}
\caption
{

}
\label{fig:uvspec}
\end{figure*} %fullpage



Figure 4 shows the synthetic spectrum in the UV from the two models, with the
benchmark model from H13 also shown for comparison. We also show a comparison
to composite quasar and BALQSO spectra in figure 5, with the optical waveband 
included. In the UV, strong BAL profiles are formed in both models. This
highlights the first success of our model: clumping allows the correct ionization state 
to be maintained in the presence of strong X-rays. 
The BAL profiles are saturated, 
and generally show the strongest absorption at the terminal velocity.
This contradicts observed profiles of many BALQSOs (REFs), 
although there are some objects which do show this behaviour (REFs). 
However, we have found that this profile shape is by no means ubiquitous.
Figure 6 shows how the line profile varies with angle for three of the UV lines
(see also section 4.4). In addition, the line profile
shape is strongly dependent on the density, ionization and velocity 
profiles intersected by the line of sight. Thus, small tweaks of the velocity
law and angular distributions of streamlines can dramatically alter
the line profile shape. Figure ?? shows selection of line profiles 
for different kinematic parameters to demonstrate this. 
The degeneracy between parameters, and lack of available
physical and observational constraints goes someway to showing why individual 
fitting of line profile shapes with kinematic models is such a difficult
exercise.

We find that model A can produce significant line emission
at low inclinations, particular in \civ, 
and the improved treatment of recombination results in a strong \la\
line. However, the red wing of the BAL profiles 
is far stronger than seen in BALQSO spectra and composites.
This is due to a combination of strong collisionally excited emission
and continuum attenuation. To illustrate the amount of 
continuum attenuation we also show the continuum from a disc-only model.
The line-to-continuum ratios at low inclinations are also
significantly affected by disc foreshortening and limb darkening.
The angular distribution of the disc radiation is clearly
crucially important in determining the emergent line equivalent widths 
(EWs) -- this is discussed further in section~5.

To assess the ability of the model to match real 
quasar spectra, we show a comparison to an HST quasar composite in figure 5. 
All the spectra are normalised to the flux at 2000\AA in these plots.
Model A matches the \civ\ line profile well, but the \la\ profile
is a factor of $\sim3$ weaker than in the composite spectrum.
Figure 5 also shows the spectrum into the optical,
showing that the outflow produces signiciant optical emission lines
as well as having a noticeable effect on the continuum shape. This
is particularly true around the Balmer jump at $3646\AA$ and is due to
a prominent wind-formed recombination continuum.


\subsection{X-ray Properties and Broadband SEDs}

\label{fig:xray}
\end{figure} %fullpage



The bottom panel of figure~\ref{fig:xray} shows the emergent $L_{2keV}$ 
monochromatic luminosity ($L_\nu$) and $\alpha_{OX}$ plotted against 
$L_\nu$ at $2500$\AA\ for a number of different viewing angles in our model.
$\alpha_{OX}$ is a spectral index from near UV to X-rays defined by

\begin{equation}
\alpha_{OX}=0.3838\log\left(\frac{L_{\nu}(2~keV)}{L_{\nu}(2500~\mbox{\scriptsize{\AA}})}\right).
\end{equation}

The properties are calculated from the synthetic spectra and thus include
the effects of wind reprocessing and attenuation. In addition to model outputs,
we also show the BALQSO sample of Saez et al. (2012) and luminous AGN and quasar
samples from Steffen et al. (2006). For low inclination, `quasar-like' viewing angles,
we now show excellent agreement with AGN samples. The trend with inclination
in our models is caused by a combination of disc foreshortening/limb-darkening 
(resulting in a lower $L_{2500}$ for higher inclinations) and the fact that the disk 
is opaque and thus the X-ray source subtends a smaller solid angle at high inclinations
(resulting in a lower $L_{2keV}$ for higher inclinations). 

Although the low inclination, `BALQSO-like' viewing angles show moderate agreement with the data,
it appears that our models tend to underpredict the emergent X-ray luminosity at 
although we are limited by poor statistics. 
It is possible that this is due to our wind being overly optically thick to 
electron scattering at angles which look through the wind. It could also be that the
isotropic X-ray source assumption is incorrect and BALQSOs are {\em intrinsically} 
X-ray weak \citep[e.g.][]{morabito2013}. Nevertheless, our input X-ray spectrum
now reproduces the X-ray properties of a luminous quasar.

Typically, BALQSOs show strong X-ray absorption with columns 
of $N_H\sim10^{23}~\rm{cm^{-2}}$ 
\citep{green1996,brandt2000,mathur2000,green2001,grupemathur2003}.
This is often cited as evidence that the BAL outflow is shielded from
the X-ray source, especially as sources with strong X-ray absorption tend
to exhibit deep BAL troughs and high outflow velocities (REFs).
Our results tend to imply that a clumpy BAL outflow
itself can be responsible for the strong X-ray absorption, and possibly 
explains why mini-BALs have weaker X-ray absorption than BALQSOs 
\citep[e.g.][]{brandt2000,hamann2013}.

We can also examine the emergent X-ray spectra from our model. 
Our code is not yet optimized for producing X-ray spectra, as we do not yet 
include all lines and levels of e.g. Fe or macro-atom treatments of 
higher order ions (cf. Sim et al. 2008, 2010). 
However, the bound-free opacity sources are complete, and comparisons of the shape
of the heavily absorbed spectra can be useful.
Figure 6 shows the broadband SED from the model, compared to a number of BALQSO spectra
from \cite{grupenousek2015} - note that lower mass and super-Eddington sources
are excluded.

\subsection{LoBALs and ionization stratification}

\caption

}
\label{fig:lobal}
\end{figure*} %fullpage



At certain sightlines, our model now produces blue-shifted BALs in \al\ and \mg --
the absorption lines seen in LoBALQSOs. Line profiles in velocity space 
for \civ, \al\ and \mg, are shown in figure~\ref{fig:lobal} for a range
of BALQSO viewing angles. We confirm the behaviour expected from 
a unification model such as Elvis (2000), in which ionization stratification
explains the incidence of LoBALQSOs. In this framework, the lower
ionization material is intercepted by a smaller family of sightlines.
This is also the explanation here, as shown by figure~\ref{fig:wind}.

These line profiles also indicate a potential problem with our model. 
\cite{odowd2015} find that the LoBAL profiles in H1413+117 have a 
higher velocity onset than the higher ionization BALs, suggesting that the
wind becomes less ionized as radius increases. 
We find the opposite trend in velocity onsets. In addition, examination of 
figure~\ref{fig:wind} shows that ionization parameter decreases with radius, 
because the decrease in density wins over geometric dilution of the radiation 
field. While the \cite{odowd2015} hypothesis comes from one object,
it is clear that {\em at least some} BALQSOs must become less ionized at 
higher velocities, contrary to what one expects from our modelling.

\section{Discussion: The Disc SED}

\subsection{Anisotropy of disc emission}

Discuss the importance of the angular distribution of the disc SED on line
(limb-darkened, foreshortened, etc.)

\subsection{General relativistic effects}

General relativistic effects -- specifically, light bending
and relativistic beaming -- can cause 
the accretion disc SED to become more isotropic \citep[e.g.][]{zhang1997,munozdarias2013}.
To generate GR disc spectra, we use the code \agn\ \citep{hubeny2000,davishubeny2006,davis2007}. 
The output flux at $2000$~\AA\ as a function of inclination
for an \agn\ model with the same disc and BH parameters
as our clumpy wind model is shown in figure~\ref{f2000}.
The effect of relativistic effects on disc anisotropy can be clearly seen.

To examine the effect of GR on our models, we carry out the following procedure.
First, we fit our output spectrum with a polynomial. This continuum fit can 
be subtracted from the actual spectrum 
to produce a model of the line emission only. We then calculate the 
`wind continuum factor', by comparing the model fit with the emergent 
disc spectrum without a wind. This factor gives us an approximate way to quantify the 
effect of the wind on a disc continuum. It will generally be $>1$ at high inclinations,
and $<1$ at low inclinations. This calculates emergent accretion disc spectra from an AGN disc atmosphere
including relativistic effects. Finally, produce our final synthetic spectrum 
by convolving this the line emission spectrum with the \agn\ model for the model parameters.

Figure 10 shows the resultant spectrum. Including GR clearly helps

\end{figure*} %fullpage

\subsection{Wind reprocessing}

How would wind reprocessing help?





\subsection{The BALQSO fraction and wind covering factor}

The disc SED has a profound effect on the intrinsic BAL fraction
inferred from flux-limited samples. This in turn impacts on 
the geometry and covering factor assumed for BALQSO and unified wind models,
and even effects the efficiency of feedback.
\cite{krolik1998} noted that the effect of limb darkening and foreshortening
would result in a signicantly underestimated covering factor for BALQSO winds.
The effect is complicated further by the quasar luminosity function -- if 
BALQSOs have lower observed luminosities for given accretion disc properties 
then they may be drawn from a different bin in the quasar luminosity function 
\citep{goodrich1997}. These effects are understandably not taken into account
by current estimates of the intrinsic BALQSO fraction \citep{weymann1991, reichard2003, knigge2008, turnermiller2009, allen2011}.
% These factors will also combine in the building-up 
% of BALQSO composite spectra, and mean that is very difficult to 
% disentangle the true nature of BALQSOs
% without BH mass and eddington ratio estimates.
The way forward is somewhat unclear. 
Given the lack of available observational constraints, models cannot readily 
be used to inform the selection criteria when calculating the BALQSO fraction.
Nevertheless, understanding the true nature of the disc SED, including the
angular distribution of radiation, is clearly crucial in order
to accurately estimate the true covering factor of BALQSO winds.

% SUMMARY

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Summary}

We have carried out MCRT simulations using a simple
prescription for a biconical disc wind, with
the aim of expanding on the work of H13 and assessing 
the viability of such a model for geometric unification of quasars.
We find the following main points:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We have introduced a first-order treatment 
of clumping in our model, and found that it can now maintain
the required ionization state while agreeing well with the X-ray
properties of AGN/QSOs.
\smallskip
\item We have shown that the degree of ionization stratification
in the model is sufficient that LoBAL line profiles
are seen at a subset of viewing angles. 
\smallskip
\item We find that clumping also causes a significant 
increase in the strength of the  emission
lines produced by the model. This is true both
of collisionally excited resonance lines (such as \civ, \nv)
and recombination lines (such as \la, \ha\ and the Balmer series).
\smallskip
\item The line EWs in our models are not comparable to those in Quasar composite
spectra. This is due to a fundamental constraint discussed in section ?. If the BLR
emits fairly isotropically then for a foreshortened, limb-darkened classical thin accretion disc
it is not possible to achieve line ratios at low inclinations that are comparable to
those at high inclinations. This is a robust conclusion which 
is independent of the assumed BLR geometry. 
\smallskip
\item We have examined the effect of GR on our disc SED, using the disc atmosphere
and GR ray-tracing code \agn. While including GR effects
does cause the disc SED to become significantly more isotropic,
the effect is not large enough to produce uniform line to continuum ratios
with viewing angle. We discuss other solutions to this problem in section ?; 
It is possible that a combination of GR and reprocessing by the wind could provide a 
solution, and a number of complicated selection effects may be at work
in the building of the quasar composites.
\end{enumerate}

Our work confirms a number of expected outcomes from such a model, and suggests 
that a simple geometry such as this can come close to explaining much of the 
phenomenology of quasars. Nevertheless, our conclusions pose a clear challenge 
to the current unification picture.
