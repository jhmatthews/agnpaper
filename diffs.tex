\begin{abstract} 
% Broad absorption lines (BALs) in the ultraviolet 
% are seen in $\sim20\%$ of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). 
% Blue-shifted broad absorption lines (BALs) are the most direct evidence of 
% accretion disc `winds' in such systems; mass loaded outflows
% emanating from the disc that may be driven by line forces or
% magnetic processes. 
% Various unification schemes for
% quasars and luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) have proposed
% that the broad emission line region is roughly cospatial
% with broad absorption line (BAL) gas and much of the phenomenology of luminous AGN
% can be explained by a simple geometrical picture involving an accretion
% disc and associated outflow. Here, we test this paradigm by 
% utilising our state-of-the-art radiative transfer code to produce synthetic spectra
% from simple biconical disc wind models. 
% In particular, we expand on our previous 
% work in which a benchmark model for BAL quasars was produced. 
% We have conducted a limited parameter search with the aim of unifying quasar phenomenology,
% and arrive at an improved model. The grid is now publicly available.
% We find that a simple treatment of clumping (`microclumping') 
% allows for a more realistic X-ray luminosity in the model by lowering the 
% ionization parameter. We examine the X-ray properties of this new model
% and find good agreement with existing X-ray samples of AGN and QSOs.
% We find that the dense, X-ray heated wind 
% produces strong H recombination and collisionally excited resonance 
% line emission to emerge at the low inclination angles, 
% which represent quasars within this unification scenario.
% % We also treat Hydrogen using a `macro-atom' approach in order to 
% % examine the effect of recombination on Hydrogen emission lines, and
% % this results in significant line emission in Lyman~$\alpha$ and the Balmer series.
% However, we are unable to reproduce the remarkably similar of line-to-continuum
% ratios between BAL and non-BAL quasar composites.
% This is due to a fundamental constraint arising
% from the anisotropy of emission from a classical thin disc. 
% We briefly explore the effect of relativistic beaming, gravitational redshift and 
% light bending on the angular distribution of disc continuum emission. 
% We find that these general relativistic effects do cause the disc to
% emit slightly more isotropically, but this is not yet sufficient to produce a
% self-consistent model. We discuss wind reprocessing as a potential solution.
% Overall, our work suggests that geometric unification
% involving an accretion disc wind is a promising scenario, but our results 
% pose a number of difficult challenges to such a model.
% Determining the true geometry of ADWs and uncovering the true disc spectral 
% (and angular) energy distribution are key next stpng if we are to build up a 
% holistic picture of the quasar population.

\DIFdelend The spectra of 
quasars and luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) 
typically exhibit a series of strong emission lines
with an underlying blue continuum - the so-called {\sl `big blue bump'} (BBB). 
The BBB is often attributed to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{emssion }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{emission }\DIFaddend from a 
geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disc surrounding the central black hole, similar
to that described by \cite{shakurasunyaev1973}.

%DIF >  The first half is about spectra the second about outflows and the connection to spectra is not made until the next paragrph.  
%DIF >  This needs fixing. JM: Knox, I like this structure...I start with inflow, then move to outflow.}
In addition to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{inflowing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\em \DIFadd{inflowing}} \DIFaddend accreting material, 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{outflows }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\em \DIFadd{outflows}} \DIFaddend are ubiquitous in AGN
and quasars \citep{kellerman1989,ganguly2008}. These outflows can take the form of 
highly collimated radio jets \citep[e.g.][]{hazard1963,potash1980,perley1984,marscher2006}, 
or mass-loaded `winds' emanating from the accretion disc 
\citep{weymann1991,turnermiller2009}. 
Outflows in AGN offer a 
potential feedback mechanism through which the central source can 
affect its environment \citep{king2003,king2005,fabian2012}
-- feedback that is required in models of galaxy evolution \citep{springel2005}
and may explain the `$M-\sigma$' relation \citep{silkrees1998,haring2004}.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Approximately $20\%$ of quasars exhibit }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Perhaps the clearest evidence of outflows in AGN is  
the }\DIFaddend blueshifted ($\sim 0.1c$) broad absorption lines (BALs) in the 
ultraviolet \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{seen in approximately $20\%$ of quasars
}\DIFaddend \citep{weymann1991, reichard2003, knigge2008, turnermiller2009, allen2011}.
The simplest explanation for the incidence of 
BAL quasars (BALQSOs) is in terms of an accretion disc wind\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(ADW). 
Within the ADW }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. 
According to this }\DIFaddend paradigm, a biconical wind rises from 
the accretion disc and the BALQSO fraction is associated with
the covering factor of the outflow. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The wind is expected }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Polarisation studies expect the wind }\DIFaddend to be roughly equatorial

}

\DIFadd{Due to their ubiquitous nature,
disc winds }\DIFaddend offer a natural explanation for the
diverse phenemonology of luminous AGN and QSOs \citep[e.g.][]{MCGV95, elvis2000}. 
Depending on viewing angle, an observer 
may see a BALQSO or normal `Type 1' quasar.
Within this \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{unification }\DIFaddend framework, the broad-line region (BLR) can 
correspond either to the dense wind base or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dense }\DIFdelend clumps embedded
in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{outflows}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{outflow}\DIFaddend . Indeed, \cite{elitzur2014} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{found }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{show }\DIFaddend that a disc-wind BLR scenario
naturally explains the emission line evolution of AGN.
A biconical wind model can also readily explain the various sub-classifications of BALQSOs: 
HiBALQSOs, which only exhibit \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{higher }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{high }\DIFaddend ionization line absorption; LoBALQSOs\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend which also show
absorption in lower ionization state species such as \mg\ and \al; and
FeLoBALQSOs\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend which show further absorption in Fe~\textsc{ii} and \textsc{iii}.
In unified \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{geometric }\DIFaddend models, this is generally attributed to ionization stratification
of the outflow \citep[e.g.][]{elvis2000}.

% As well as acting as a source of photoionized plasma, a

%DIF > {\bf ksl: I don't see what this paragraph has to do with our problem, which we need to clearly explain} Despite the clear importance of ADWs in understanding AGN SEDs and accretion physics,
Despite the clear importance of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ADWs in understanding AGN SEDs and accretion physics}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{disc winds in shaping quasar and AGN spectra}\DIFaddend ,  
much of the underlying outflow physics remains highly uncertain. 
Several possible driving mechanisms \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for ADWs }\DIFdelend have been proposed, including
thermal pressure \citep{weymann1982, begelman1991}, magnetocentrifugal forces 
\citep{blandfordpayne,pelletier_pudritz} and 
radiation pressure on spectral lines \citep[`line-driving';][]{lucysolomon1970,shlosman1985,MCGV95}.
Of these, line-driving is possibly the most attractive, as
strong absorption lines are already seen in BALQSOs and the X-ray spectra of AGN 
\citep{reeves2003,poundsreeves2009,tombesi2010a}.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend efficiency of line-driving is crucially dependent on the ionization state 
of the outflowing plasma, meaning that it is difficult to prevent 
the wind becoming over-ionized and `failing' in the presence of strong X-rays. 
\cite{MCGV95} proposed a potential solution: 
a region of `hitchhiking gas' that could shield the wind from the central X-ray source. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Hydrodynamic simulations of line-driven disc winds also found a shielding region

An additional or alternative solution is that the wind is clumped \citep[e.g.][]{hamann2013}
possibly on multiple scale lengths. Local density enhancements could lower the 
ionization parameter of the plasma while still maintaining the same mass-loss 
rate and column density. 

Evidence for dense substructures in AGN winds is widespread.
BALQSOs show complex absorption line profiles \citep{ganguly2006, simonhamann2010}
and exhibit variability in these profile shapes \citep{capellupo2011,capellupo2012,capellupo2014}.
AGN generally show variability in X-ray absorption components \citep[e.g.][]{risaliti2002}
and many models for the BLR consist of clumps embedded in an outflow 
\citep{krolik1981, emmering1992, dekool1995, cassidyraine1996}.
Clumping can be caused by magnetic confinement \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{dekool1995}
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{dekool1995}

or the instabilities inherent to line-driven winds 
\citep{lucysolomon1970,macgregor1979,carlberg1980,owockirybicki1984,owockirybicki1985}.
Additionally, clumping is required to explain the electron scattering wings of emission lines formed
in line-driven hot star winds \citep{hillier1991eswingsmodel}. Complex substructures 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on a variety of scales }\DIFdelend are also produced in simulations of line-driven 
outflows in AGN\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{PSK2000,PK04,progakurosawa2010,proga2014}
}%DIFAUXCMD
.
Clumpy winds therefore }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, although on very different scales to line-driven instabilities 
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{PSK2000,PK04,progakurosawa2010,proga2014}
}%DIFAUXCMD
.
Nevertheless, clumpy winds }\DIFaddend offer an observationally motivated and theoretically 
predicted way to lower the ionization state of a plasma, possibly in tandem
with a shielding scenario. 


% An inhomogenous outflow has been proposed as a model for the BLR (REFs)
% Clumping is expected in outflows and BLRs.

% The UV spectrum of {\em non-BAL} QSOs is typified by a series
% of strong emission lines (e.g. \la, \civ, \nv) with an underlying blue continuum
% - the so-called {\sl `big blue bump'} (BBB). The BBB is normally attributed to blackbody-like
% emission from an accretion disc surrounding the central black hole (REF), similar
% to that described by \cite{shakurasunyaev1973}. However,
% a number of issues have arisen relating to this model. First, 
% AGN/QSO spectra exhibit a `break' in the spectrum at around $1000$~\AA 
% which scales only weakly with black hole mass. This potentially 
% suggests a problem with a thin disc model (e.g. Antonucci). 
% However, it is possible that this is the result of incorrect intergalactic medium
% (IGM) corrections (REF) or corresponds to the temperature 
% at which a line-driven wind carries mass away from the system (laor davis).
% Second, results from microlensing (REFs) imply that the disc emission 
% region is $\sim4$ times larger than one might expect from a Shakura-Sunyaev
% model. Inhomogenous discs have been proposed as an alternative (REFs).
% These observations appear to pose problems for the thin disc model of luminous,
% sub-Eddington AGN. However, recent results from \cite{capellupo2015} find 
% that if one includes a combination of mass-loss, general relativity (GR) and Comptonisation
% then AGN SEDs can, in general, be fitted well with accretion disc models.
% Uncovering the intrinsic disc SED and understanding the effect of the outflow on the accretion 
% mechanism is clearly crucial if we are to properly understand the physical nature
% of AGN.

% The geometry and size of the BLR is also a matter of contention.

\section{Ionization and Radiative Transfer}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For this study, we }\DIFaddend use the MCRT code \py\ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we have developed }\DIFaddend to carry out our 
radiative transfer and photoionization \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{calculations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{simulations }\DIFaddend in non-local thermodynamic

(Long \& Knigge 2002, hereafter LK02; Noebauer et al. 2010;

Once these ``ionization cycles'' are complete, then a series of further iterations

\DIFaddend \subsection{Line transfer}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To treat line transfer , we adopt the same hybrid scheme 
described by 
M15}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our approach to line transfer is based upon the macro-atom implementation developed by 
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

terms of indivisible energy quanta of radiant or kinetic energy

These }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{sec:photon_sources}).

described by M15.
%DIF > (an improvement over that used by H14 for our earlier quasar study), 
In this scheme, the }\DIFaddend energy packets interact with either two-level `simple ions' 
or full `macro-atoms'. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The macro-atom implementation 
is described in full by \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

without approximation for elements \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that }\DIFaddend are identified as 
full macro-atoms, while maintaining the fast `two-level' 
treatment of resonance lines when elements are identified 
as simple-ions (see M15). In this study,
only H is treated as a macro-atom, because 
we expect recombination to be important
in determining \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{its }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{their }\DIFaddend level populations and resultant line emission\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and because we were especially interested in the contribution to AGN spectra of }\LA\DIFadd{.  
H13 treated all atoms in a two-level approximation.
}\DIFaddend 

\subsection{Ionization Scheme}

Macro-atoms have their ion and level populations derived from
MC rate estimators as described by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{M15}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Lucy (2002,2003)}\DIFaddend . Previously (LK02, H13, M15),
we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{adopted }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used }\DIFaddend a modified Saha approach to calculate the ionization fractions
of simple-ions. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As part of  this effort, we }\DIFaddend have now improved \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{our code }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\sc \DIFadd{PYTHON}} \DIFaddend to explicitly solve the 
rate equations between ions in non-LTE. This dispenses with a number of small assumptions 
made in the modified Saha approach, is more numerically stable, and, in principle, allows 
the direct addition of extra physical processes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{such as Auger ionization}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that would previously have necessitated 
approximate treatments}\DIFaddend .

%DIF < To avoid approximating the complex AGN SED as e.g. a dilute blackbody \citep[][M15]{ML93},
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In order to calculate the photoionization rate, 
we }\DIFaddend model the SED in a \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{grid }\DIFaddend cell using the technique described by H13. In this scheme,
the mean intensity\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, $J_{\nu}$ }\DIFaddend in a series of $n$ bands is modeled as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a normalised power law }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{either a power law or exponential

%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{for a band $i$, or an exponential 
}\begin{displaymath}\DIFdel{
J_{\nu,i}=K_{exp} e^{(-h\nu/k T_{exp})}.
}\end{displaymath}
%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{Here, $K_{exp}$}\DIFdelend , \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$K_{pl}$, $T_{exp}$ and $\alpha_{pl}$ are spectral }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with the }\DIFaddend fit parameters deduced from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend band-limited radiation field estimators.

%DIF >  Here, $K_{exp}$, $K_{pl}$, $T_{exp}$ and $\alpha_{pl}$ are spectral fit parameters

The ionization rate out of ion $j$ can then be written as 
\begin{equation}
R_{j,j+1}(J)= 
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \displaystyle{
%DIFDELCMD < n_i \left(C_{j} n_e + 
%DIFDELCMD < \sum_{band~i=0}^{n}~
%DIFDELCMD < {\int_{\nu_i}^{~\nu_i+1}{J_{\nu,i}\sigma_j(\nu)\nu^{-1}d\nu}}
%DIFDELCMD < \right),}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \displaystyle{
n_j \left(C_{j} n_e + 
\sum_{band~i=0}^{n}~
{\int_{\nu_i}^{~\nu_i+1} \frac{4 \pi J_{\nu,i}\sigma_j(\nu)}  {h \nu} d\nu}
\right),}
\DIFaddend \end{equation}
where $\sigma_j$ is the photoionization cross-section\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, $n_e$
is the electron density }\DIFaddend and $C_{j}$
represents the collisional ionization coefficient.
The recombination rate {\em into} ion $j$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
R_{j+1,j}(T_e) = (\alpha^j_{RR} + \alpha^j\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{_{DR} + \alpha^j}\DIFdelend _{CR}) n_{j+1} n_e,
\end{equation}
where each $\alpha^j$ here is the recombination rate coefficient into the ground state of ion $j$.
The subscripts denote radiative \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, dielectronic }\DIFdelend and 
collisional (three-body) recombination, respectively. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We neglect recombination to and from excited states in the simple-ion calculation.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$T_e$ is the electron temperature.
%DIF > % We neglect recombination to and from excited states in the simple-ion calculation. 
}\DIFaddend For simple-ions, we use a dilute Boltzmann equation to calculate 
the population of level $k$ in ionic stage $j$,
\begin{equation}
\frac{n_{jk}}{n_j} = \frac{W g_k}{z_j(T_R)} \exp(-E_k/kT_R).
\end{equation}
Here $z_j$ is the partition function of ionic stage $j$,
$T_R$ is the effective radiation temperature,
$E_k$ is the energy difference between level $k$ and the ground state,
and $g_k$ is the statistical weight of level $k$. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We stress that this approximation is not required for ions
treated as macro-atoms.
}\DIFaddend 

%DIF <  We improve on this method by abandoning the modified Saha approach
%DIF <  entirely, and instead computing the ionization state by 
%DIF <  explicitly solving the rate equations in between ions in non-LTE. 
%DIF <  Photoionization and recombination rates are calculated using MC estimators recorded
%DIF <  during the photon propagation. Not only does this dispense with a number of
%DIF <  small assumptions made in the modified Saha approach, it is also more numerically stable, 
%DIF <  and in principle allows the direct addition of extra physical processes such as Auger ionization, which would have to be approximated if using the previous technique.
\subsection{Physical Processes}

We include all free-free, bound-free and bound-bound heating
and cooling processes in the model. For radiative transfer purposes
we treat electron scattering in the Thomson limit, 
but take full account of Compton heating and cooling when
calculating the thermal balance of the plasma (see H13).
Adiabatic cooling is included and represents the only
departure from strict radiative equilibrium, but is insignificant 
in most of the outflow.
% It is dealt with self consistently by the spontaneous destruction
% of $k$-packets with a probability

% \begin{equation}
% P_{\rm{adiabatic~destruction}} = \frac{C_{\rm{adiabatic}}}{C_{\rm{total}}},
% \end{equation}
% where $C_{\rm{adiabatic}}$ and ${C_{\rm{total}}}$ represent the 
% adiabatic and total cooling rates in the cell.


\subsection{Atomic Data}

We use the same atomic data as described by LK02 and since updated by H13 and M15, 
with the addition of direct \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ionization }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(collisional) ionization and recombination
}\DIFaddend data from \cite{dere2007}. 
Photoionization cross-sections are from \textsc{Topbase} \citep{cunto1993} and \cite{vfky}.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Dielectronic and radiative }\DIFdelend %DIF > Dielectronic and 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Radiative }\DIFaddend recombination rate coefficients are taken from 
the \textsc{Chianti} database version 7.0 \citep{dere1997,landi2012}.
We use ground state recombination rates from \cite{badnell2006} where available,
and otherwise default to calculating recombination rates from the Milne
relation. Free-free Gaunt factors are from \cite{sutherland1998}.

\section{A Clumpy Biconical Disk Wind Model for Quasars}

Our kinematic prescription for a biconical disc wind model
follows \cite{SV93}, and is described further by
LK02, H13 and M15. A schematic is shown in figure~\ref{fig:cartoon},
with key aspects marked. The general biconical
geometry is similar to that invoked by \cite{MCGV95} and 
\cite{elvis2000} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in order }\DIFdelend to explain the phenomenonology
of quasars and BALQSOs.

\DIFaddbegin \label{sec:photon_sources}

%DIF < Describe the photon sources in the model.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{The accretion disc }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We include two sources of r-packets }\DIFaddend in our model\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{:
An accretion disc and central X-ray source.
The accretion disc is assumed to be }\DIFaddend geometrically thin, but optically thick.
We thus treat the disc as an ensemble of blackbodies with a 
\cite{shakurasunyaev1973} effective temperature profile. 
The emergent SED is then determined by the specified accretion rate ($\dot{m}$)
and central BH mass ($M_{BH}$).
All photon sources in our model are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assumed to beopaque}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{opaque}\DIFaddend , meaning
that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{photons }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{r-packets }\DIFaddend which strike them are destroyed.
The inner radius of the disc extends to the innermost 
stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the BH. 
We assume a Schwarzchild BH with an ISCO at $6~r_G$, where 
$r_G = GM_{BH}/c^2$ is the gravitational radius.
For a $10^9~M_\odot$ black hole, this is equal to $8.8\times10^{14}~{\rm cm}$ 
or $\sim10^{-4}~{\rm pc}$.  


The X-ray source \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in our model }\DIFdelend is treated as an isotropic sphere at the ISCO,
which emits r-packets according to a power law in flux with index $\alpha_X$, of the form
\begin{equation}
F_X (\nu) = K\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_X }\DIFaddend \nu^{\alpha_X}.
\end{equation}
The normalisation, $K_X$ of this power law is such that it 
produces the specified 2-10~keV luminosity, $L_X$.
In addition to the disc and X-ray source, 
the wind is able to reprocess radiation. However, new 
photon packets are not produced in the wind (as in LK02). 
Instead, this reprocessing is dealt with by enforcing strict
radiative equilibrium ({\em modulo} adiabatic cooling; see section~2.3)
via an indivisible energy packet
constraint (see Lucy 2002, M15).

\DIFdelend \subsection{Kinematics and Geometry}

In our model, a biconical disc wind rises from the accretion 
disc between launch radii $r_{min}$ and $r_{max}$.
The opening angles of the wind are set to $\theta_{min}$ and $\theta_{max}$.
The poloidal velocity along each individual streamline at a poloidal distance $l$ 
is then given by
\begin{equation}
v_l=v_0+\left[v_{\infty}(r_0)-v_0\right]\frac{\left(l/R_v\right)^{\alpha}}{\left(l/R_v\right)^{\alpha}+1},
\label{v_law}
\end{equation}
where $v_0$ is the velocity at the base of the streamline, $\alpha$ is
an exponent governing how quickly the wind accelerations and 
$R_v$ is the `acceleration length', defined as the distance at which
the outflow reaches half of its terminal velocity, $v_{\infty}$.
The terminal velocity is set to a fixed multiple of the escape
velocity, $v_{esc}$, at the base of the streamline (radius $r_0$).
The rotational velocity, $v_{\phi}$, is initially Keplerian ($v_k = [GM/r_0]^{1/2}$),
and the wind conserves specific angular momentum, such that 
\begin{equation}
v_{\phi} r = v_k r_0.
\label{v_law}
\end{equation}
The velocity law is crucial in determining the output spectra,
as it affects not only the projected velocities along the line of sight,
but also the density and ionization state of the outflow.
A wind \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that }\DIFaddend accelerates more slowly will have a denser wind base
with correspondingly different ionization and emission characteristics.

\subsection{\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A First Approximation for }\DIFaddend Clumping}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our previous modelling efforts assumed a smooth outflow, 
in which the density at a given point was determined only by the 
kinematic parameters and mass loss rate. However, as already discussed,
AGN winds exhibit significant substructure -- the outflow is expected to be
}{\em \DIFadd{clumpy}}\DIFadd{, rather than smooth, and probably on a variety of scales. 
Implementing a treatment of clumping is challenging, for
two main reasons. First, there are significant 
computational difficulties associated with adequately
resolving and realistically modelling a series of small scale, high density
regions with a MCRT code. Second, the addition of multiple additional degrees of
freedom in the model results in significantly wider parameter space.
Unfortunately, the physical scale lengths and density contrasts 
associated with these parameters cannot be well-constrained from observations.
}

\DIFaddend To allow for clumping in our outflow we adopt a simple approximation
used \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{extensively }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{successfully }\DIFaddend in stellar wind modelling, known as 
{\em microclumping} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{hamann1998}
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{hamann1998,hamann2008}
}%DIFAUXCMD
(MORE REFS)}\DIFaddend . 
The key assumption \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{here }\DIFdelend is that typical clump sizes are much smaller than the 
typical photon mean free path, and thus the clumps are 
both geometrically and optically thin. This approach 
allows one to introduce a `\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{volume }\DIFaddend filling factor', \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$f$, which is the 
fraction of the volume of the plasma filled by clumps}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$f_V$}\DIFaddend . 
The intra-clump medium is assumed to be a vacuum\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. We can then introduce the density enhancement, $D$, which is defined as 
}\begin{displaymath}\DIFdel{
D = \frac{1}{f}.
}\end{displaymath}
%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{We then multiply all densities in the model by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, so the 
density of the clumps is then multiplied by the ``density enhancement'' 
$D=1/f_V$. Opacities, $\kappa$, and emissivities, $\epsilon$, 
can then be expressed as 
}

%DIF >  \begin{subequations}
%DIF >  \begin{align}
%DIF >          \kappa &= f_V \kappa_C(D) \\
%DIF >          \epsilon &= f_V \epsilon_C(D)
%DIF >  \end{align}
%DIF >  \end{subequations}
\begin{equation}\DIFadd{
\kappa = f_V \kappa_C(D);~~\epsilon = f_V \epsilon_C(D).
}\end{equation}
%DIF >  \kappa = f_V \kappa_C(D) && \epsilon = f_V \epsilon_C(D).
%DIF >  \end{equation}
\DIFadd{Here the subscript $C$ denotes that the quantity is calculated using the 
enhanced density in the clump. The resultant effect is that }{\em \DIFadd{linear}} \DIFadd{processes,
such as electron scattering, are unchanged, as $f_V$ and }\DIFaddend $D$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and all emitting volumes

}}
\label{fig:wind}
\end{figure*} %DIF > fullpage

\DIFaddend Figure~\ref{fig:wind} shows the physical properties of the wind.
The wind rises slowly from the disc at first, with clumped densities
of $n_H \sim 10^{11}~\rm{cm^{-3}}$ close to the disc plane.
The flow then accelerates over a scale length of $R_V=10^{19}~\rm{cm}$
up to a terminal velocity equal to the escape velocity at the streamline base
($\sim10,000~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$). This gradual acceleration means that
the wind exhibits a stratified ionization structure, with low ionization material
in the base of the wind giving way to highly ionized plasma further out.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:wind} 
by the panels showing the ion fraction $F=n_j/n_{tot}$ of some important ions.
}\DIFaddend By clumping the wind, we are able to produce the range of ionization states observed
in quasars and BALQSOs, while adopting a realistic $2-10$ keV X-ray luminosity
of $L_{X}=10^{45}~\rm{ergs~s^{-1}}$. Without clumping, this wind would be over-ionized 
to the extent that opacities in e.g., \civ\ would be entirely negligible (see H13).

One common way to quantify the ionization state of a plasma
is through the ionization parameter, $U_H$, given by
\begin{equation}
U_H = \frac{4\pi}{n_H c}\int_{13.6{\rm{eV}}}^{\infty}\frac{{J_{\nu}d\nu}}{h\nu}.
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\rm{n_H}$ is the local number density of H, and $\nu$ denotes photon 
frequency. Shown in figure~\ref{fig:wind},
the ionization parameter is a useful measure of the global ionization state,
as it represents the ratio of the number density of 
H ionizing photons to the local H density.
It is, however, a poor representation of the 
ionization state of species such as \civ\ as it encodes no information
about the shape of the SED. In our case, the X-ray photons 
are dominant in the photoionization of the UV resonance line ions. 
This explains why a factor of 100 increase in X-ray luminosity requires
a clumping factor of 0.01, even though the value of $U_H$ decreases by only a factor of $\sim10$ 
compared to H13. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This is also the reason for significant Lyman edge photoabsorption
at the highest inclinations (see section 4.3).
}\DIFdelend %DIF > This is also the reason for significant Lyman edge photoabsorption
%DIF > at the highest inclinations (see section 4.3).

Clumping also causes the total line luminosity to increase dramatically,
as recombination and collisional excitation are both proportional to
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$n_e^2$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{density squared}\DIFaddend . This line emission typically emerges on the edge of the wind
nearest the central source. The location of the line emitting regions
is dependent on the ionization state, as well as the X-rays heating the plasma.
The radii of these emitting regions is important,
and can be compared to observations. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The line luminosities 
shown in the figure correspond to the luminosity in $\LUM$ of photons
escaping the Sobolev region for each line. 
This is equivalent to $\beta_{ul} n_u A_{ul}$, where the three quantities
represent the Sobolev escape probability, upper level number density and 
Einstein A coefficient for the line. 
}\DIFaddend As shown in figure~\ref{fig:wind},
the \civ\ line in our model is typically formed between 
$100-1000~r_G$ ($\sim10^{17}-10^{18}~\rm{cm}$).
This is in rough agreement with the reverberation mapping 
results of Kaspi (2000) for the $2.6\times10^{9} M_\odot$ quasar S5 0836+71,
and also compares favourably with microlensing measurements of the size of the
\civ\ emission line region in the BALQSO H1413+117 \citep{odowd2015}.

We show a cartoon illustrating how geometric effects determine
the output spectra in figure~\ref{fig:sightline}.  

\subsubsection{Broad absorption lines \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(`BALQSO-like' angles)}\DIFaddend }

The UV spectrum is characterised by strong BAL 
profiles at high inclinations ($> 70^\circ$). 
This highlights the first success of our model: 
clumping means the correct ionization state 
is maintained in the presence of strong X-rays, 
allowing large resonance line opacities. 
At the highest inclinations, the 
cooler, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lower }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{low }\DIFaddend ionization material at the base of the wind
starts to intersect the line of sight. This produces 
multiple absorption lines in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lower ionization }\DIFdelend species such as \mg,
\al\ and Fe~\textsc{ii}. The potential links to LoBALQSOs and 
FeLoBALQSOs are discussed in section 2.4.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Clearly, the absorption lines in the 
synthetic spectra at BALQSO-like angles do not match the composites; this
is }{\em \DIFadd{not}} \DIFadd{due to a failure of our model, but rather because a geometric mean
BALQSO composite spectrum tends to wash out the broad absorption features due to the wide
range of absorption characteristics. To demonstrate this, we show a comparison 
to a }{\sl \DIFadd{Hubble Space Telescope}} \DIFadd{STIS spectrum of the high BALnicity BALQSO PG0946+301 
(Arav et al. 2000) in figure \ref{fig:stis}. 
}\DIFaddend 

The high ionization BAL profiles are often saturated, and the location in velocity space
of the strongest absorption in the profile varies with inclination.
At \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lower inclinations}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the lowest inclination BAL sightlines}\DIFaddend , the strongest absorption occurs at the red edge,
whereas at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{high }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{higher }\DIFaddend inclinations (and for the strongest BALs)
the trough has a sharp edge at the terminal velocity.
This offers one potential explanation for the wide range of BALQSO absorption
line shapes (see e.g. Trump et al. 2006; Knigge et al 2008\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, Filiz Ak et al. 2014}\DIFaddend ).
In addition, the line profile shape is strongly dependent 
on the density, ionization and velocity 
profiles intersected by the line of sight. Thus, small tweaks of the velocity
law and angular distributions of streamlines can dramatically alter
the shape of the line.

Nonblack saturation is observed in the absorption troughs of BALQSOs \citep{arav1999a,arav1999b}.
This can be caused either by partial covering of the continuum
source or by scattered contributions to the BAL troughs, necessarily
from an opacity source not cospatial with the BAL forming region.
The scattered light explanation is supported by spectropolarimetry results
\citep{lamy2000}. Our spectra do not show nonblack saturation.
Instead, we find black, saturated troughs at angles $i > 73^\circ$, and the BALs
are non-saturated at lower inclinations. The reasons for this are readily apparent. 
First, the microclumping assumption does not allow for 
porosity in the wind, meaning that it does not naturally produce
a partial covering absorber. To do this, an alternative approach
such as {\em macroclumping} would be required \citep[e.g.][]{surlan2012,hamann2008}.
Second, our wind does not have a significant scattering 
contribution along sightlines which do not pass through the BAL region,
meaning that any scattered \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contribution is obscured by the saturated troughs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{component to the BAL troughs is absorbed by line opacity}\DIFaddend .
This suggests that either the scattering cross-section of the wind must
be increased (with higher mass loss rates or covering factors), or 
that an additional source of electron opacity is required, potentially
in a polar direction above the disc.

The }\DIFaddend improved treatment of recombination \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{also }\DIFaddend results in a strong \la\ line. 
In the context of unification, this is a promising result, 
and shows that a biconical wind can produce significant 
emission at `quasar-like' angles.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This is because we do not yet treat C as a full macro-atom with a

\citep{wei1988}
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , which is higher than much of the 
outer portion of our wind. 
We therefore expect \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{intercombination lines
to become important coolants in the outer portion of the wind}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a model with these 
parameters to produce a C~}\textsc{\DIFadd{iii}}]\DIFadd{~1909\AA}\ \DIFadd{line
with a proper treament}\DIFaddend . 

The model produces strong emission lines in \civ, \nv\ and \la,
as well as a weak \mg\ line. The shapes and widths of these lines
match the composites fairly well. However, the line-to-continuum ratios 
at low inclinations in our model are significantly weaker than the quasar 
composites. Increasing the density of the outflow, by altering the mass 
loss rate  or velocity law, can produce more line emission.
However, the red wing of the BAL profiles is generally stronger than 
seen in BALQSO spectra and composites. This illustrates a fundamental 
problem with a geometric unification model such as this:
that the line-to-continuum ratios at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{low }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hight }\DIFaddend inclinations are
significantly affected by disc foreshortening and limb darkening.
The angular distribution of the disc radiation is clearly
crucially important in determining the emergent line ratios.

%DIF > {\bf:  Again this section needs an introduction.  Why is this important?}
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{One of the main motivations for including a treatment of clumping was
to avoid over-ionization of the wind in the presence of strong X-rays. 
Having verified that strong BALs appear in the synthetic spectra,
it is also important to assess whether the X-ray properties of this
next-generation model agree well with quasar and BALQSO samples for the relevant
inclinations.
}

\DIFaddend Figure~\ref{fig:xray} shows the emergent
monochromatic luminosity ($L_\nu$) at 2~keV and 
%$\alpha_{OX}$ 
plotted against $L_\nu$ at $2500$\AA\ for a number of different viewing angles in our model.
% $\alpha_{OX}$ is a spectral index from near UV to X-rays defined by
% \begin{equation}
% \alpha_{OX}=0.3838\log\left(\frac{L_{\nu}(2~keV)}{L_{\nu}(2500~\mbox{\scriptsize{\AA}})}\right),
% \end{equation}
% which effectively represents a near-UV to X-ray flux ratio and a measure of X-ray 
% weakness. 
The monochromatic luminosities are calculated from the synthetic spectra and thus include
the effects of wind reprocessing and attenuation. In addition to model outputs,
we also show the BALQSO sample of Saez et al. (2012) and luminous AGN and quasar
samples from Steffen et al. (2006). The best fit relation from Steffen et al. (2006) 
is also shown. For low inclination, `quasar-like' viewing angles,
we now \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{show }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{find }\DIFaddend excellent agreement with AGN samples. The gradient from $20^\circ$ to
$60^\circ$ in our models is caused by a combination of disc foreshortening/limb-darkening 
(resulting in a lower $L_{2500}$ for higher inclinations) and the fact that the disk 
is opaque, and thus the X-ray source subtends a smaller solid angle at high inclinations
(resulting in a lower $L_{2keV}$ for higher inclinations). 



The low inclination, `BALQSO-like' viewing angles show moderate agreement with the data,
and are X-ray weak due to bound-free and electron scattering opacities in the wind.
Typically, BALQSOs show strong X-ray absorption with columns 
of $N_H\sim10^{23}~\rm{cm^{-2}}$ 
\citep{green1996,mathur2000,green2001,grupemathur2003}.
This is often cited as evidence that the BAL outflow is shielded from
the X-ray source, especially as sources with strong X-ray absorption tend
to exhibit deep BAL troughs and high outflow velocities 
\citep{brandt2000,laorbrandt2002,gallagher2006}.
Our results imply that the clumpy BAL outflow
itself can be responsible for the strong X-ray absorption, 
and supports Hamann et al.'s (2013) suggestion that 
this explains the weaker X-ray absorption in mini-BALs 
compared to BALQSOs.

Our models slightly over-predict the emergent X-ray luminosity at BAL angles, 
although we are limited by poor sample sizes. 
% It is possible that this is due to our wind being overly optically thick to 
% electron scattering at angles which look through the wind. 
If BALQSOs were {\em intrinsically} 
X-ray weak \citep[as suggested by, e.g.][]{morabito2013},
our isotropic assumption \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{foe }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for }\DIFaddend the X-ray source would be incorrect. 
A polar-biased X-ray source would result in a lower clumping factor being
required in our model. Our specific wind
prescription will also affect the opacities, densities and resultant
ionization structure, which can change the absorption characteristics and resultant
luminosities.
Nevertheless, our input X-ray spectrum
now reproduces the X-ray properties of a luminous quasar as an output,
and at least some BAL angles match the observations.
This satisifies the first-order requirement for the X-ray properties of 
a unified quasar model.

% We can also examine the emergent X-ray spectra from our model. 
% Our code is not yet optimized for producing X-ray spectra, as we do not yet 
% include all lines and levels of e.g. Fe or macro-atom treatments of 
% higher order ions (cf. Sim et al. 2008, 2010). 
% However, the bound-free opacity sources are complete, and comparisons of the shape
% of the heavily absorbed spectra can be useful.
% Figure 6 shows the broadband SED from the model, compared to a number of BALQSO spectra

\end{figure*} %fullpage


At certain sightlines, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{our model now produces }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the synthetic spectra exhibit }\DIFaddend blue-shifted BALs in \al\ and \mg --
the absorption lines seen in LoBALQSOs, and we even see absorption in Fe~\textsc{ii}
at the highest inclinations. Line profiles in velocity space 
for \civ, \al\ and \mg, are shown in figure~\ref{fig:lobal} for a range
of BALQSO viewing angles. We find that ionization stratification
of the wind causes lower ionization material \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to have }\DIFaddend a smaller covering factor, 
as demonstrated by figures~\ref{fig:wind} and \ref{fig:lobal}.
This confirms the behaviour expected from a unification model such as Elvis (2000). 
LoBALs are only present at viewing angles close to edge-on ($i>75^\circ$),
as predicted by polarisation results \citep{brotherton1997}.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As observed in a BALQSO sample by \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{filizak2014}
}%DIFAUXCMD
, we find that
BAL troughs are wider and deeper when low ionization absorption features are present,
and high ionization lines have higher blue-edge velocities than the 
low ionization species.
}\DIFaddend There is also a correlation between the strength of LoBAL features
and the amount of continuum attenuation at that sightline, particularly
blueward of the Lyman edge as the low ionization base 
intersects the line-of-sight. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Our model }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A model such as this }\DIFaddend therefore predicts that LoBALQSOs and FeLoBALQSOs 
have stronger Lyman edge absorption and 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are }\DIFaddend more Compton-thick than HiBALQSOs and Type 1 quasars.
An edge-on scenario also offers a potential explanation for the rarity of LoBAL and
FeLoBAL quasars, due to a foreshortened and attenuated continuum, 
although, as noted in section~\ref{discsed}, BAL fraction 
inferences are fraught with complex selection effects.

%DIF >  \subsection{Wind reprocessing}

%DIF >  If the majority of continuum radiation was reprocessed by nearby photoionized plasma (such

%DIF >  \citep{reeves2003,poundsreeves2009,tombesi2010a}.
%DIF >  We note that spectropolarimetry of BALQSOs shows that the light from BAL troughs is $\sim10\%$

%DIF >  \subsection{General relativistic effects}

%DIF >  General relativistic effects -- specifically, light bending
%DIF >  and relativistic beaming -- can cause 
%DIF >  the accretion disc SED to become more isotropic \citep[e.g.][]{zhang1997,munozdarias2013}.

prescription for a biconical disc wind, with
the aim of expanding on the work of H13 and assessing 
the viability of such a model for geometric unification of quasars.
We find the following main points:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We have introduced a first-order treatment 
of clumping in our model, and found that it can now maintain
the required ionization state while agreeing well with the X-ray
properties of AGN/QSOs.
\smallskip
\item We have shown that the degree of ionization stratification
in the model is sufficient that LoBAL line profiles
are seen at a subset of viewing angles, and Fe~\textsc{ii}
absorption is seen at particularly high inclinations.
\smallskip
\item We find that clumping also causes a significant 
increase in the strength of the  emission
lines produced by the model. This is true both
of collisionally excited resonance lines (such as \civ, \nv)
and recombination lines (such as \la, \ha\ and the Balmer series).
\smallskip
\item The line EWs in our models increase with inclination.
BAL and non-BAL quasar composites have comparable EWs, so our model
fails to reproduce this behaviour.
This is due to a fundamental constraint discussed further in section 5. If the BLR
emits fairly isotropically then for a foreshortened, limb-darkened classical thin accretion disc
it is simply not possible to achieve line ratios at low inclinations that are comparable to
those at high inclinations. This is a robust conclusion which 
is independent of the assumed BLR geometry and size.

Our work confirms a number of expected outcomes from a geometric unification 
model, and suggests that a simple biconical geometry such as this can come close to 
explaining much of the  phenomenology of quasars. Nevertheless, our conclusions pose 
a clear challenge to the current disc wind unification picture.
