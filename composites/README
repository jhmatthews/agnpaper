Composite spectra as a function of BALQSO type from Reichard et
al. 2003, "A Catalog of Broad Absorption Line Quasars from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Early Data Release", AJ, 125, 1711 and Reichard et
al. 2003, "Continuum and Emission-Line Properties of Broad Absorption
Line Quasars", AJ, in press.

Each spectrum has the wavelength, flux density, uncertainty and number
of objects that contribute to that bin.

High-ionization, low-ionization, high- and low-ionization, and FeII
low-ionization BALQSO composites:

sdssedrqsobal.hibal.spec
sdssedrqsobal.lobal.spec
sdssedrqsobal.hilobal.spec
sdssedrqsobal.felobal.spec

non-BALQSO composite with number of objects normalized by absolute
magnitude and redshift to match the above samples:

sdssedrqsobal.nonbal.spec
